abstract = {In recent years, diffusion MRI has become an extremely important tool for studying the morphology of living brain tissue, as it provides unique insights into both its macrostructure and microstructure. Recent applications of diffusion MRI aimed to characterize the structural connectome using tractography to infer connectivity between brain regions. In parallel to the development of tractography, additional diffusion MRI based frameworks (CHARMED, AxCaliber, ActiveAx) were developed enabling the extraction of a multitude of micro-structural parameters (axon diameter distribution, mean axonal diameter and axonal density). This unique insight into both tissue microstructure and connectivity has enormous potential value in understanding the structure and organization of the brain as well as providing unique insights to abnormalities that underpin disease states. The CONNECT (Consortium Of Neuroimagers for the Non-invasive Exploration of brain Connectivity and Tracts) project aimed to combine tractography and micro-structural measures of the living human brain in order to obtain a better estimate of the connectome, while also striving to extend validation of these measurements. This paper summarizes the project and describes the perspective of using micro-structural measures to study the connectome.},

abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset is freely accessible at www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon\_1000/.},

Topological and geometrical properties of these graphs can be measured and compared to random graphs and to graphs derived from other neuroscience data or other (nonneural) complex systems. Both structural and functional human brain graphs have consistently demonstrated key topological properties such as small-worldness, modularity, and heterogeneous degree distributions. Brain graphs are also physically embedded so as to nearly minimize wiring cost, a key geometric property. Here we offer a conceptual review and methodological guide to graphical analysis of human neuroimaging data, with an emphasis on some of the key assumptions, issues, and trade-offs facing the investigator.},

abstract = {The application of multivoxel pattern analysis methods has attracted increasing attention, particularly for brain state prediction and real-time functional MRI applications. Support vector classification is the most popular of these techniques, owing to reports that it has better prediction accuracy and is less sensitive to noise. Support vector classification was applied to learn functional connectivity patterns that distinguish patients with depression from healthy volunteers. In addition, two feature selection algorithms were implemented (one filter method, one wrapper method) that incorporate reliability information into the feature selection process. These reliability feature selections methods were compared to two previously proposed feature selection methods. A support vector classifier was trained that reliably distinguishes healthy volunteers from clinically depressed patients. The reliability feature selection methods outperformed previously utilized methods. The proposed framework for applying support vector classification to functional connectivity data is applicable to other disease states beyond major depression.},

The use of only 5 minutes of resting-state fcMRI data from 238 scans of typically developing volunteers (ages 7 to 30 years) allowed prediction of individual brain maturity as a functional connectivity maturation index. The resultant functional maturation curve accounted for 55\% of the sample variance and followed a nonlinear asymptotic growth curve shape.

abstract = {In recent years, pathophysiological models of brain disorders have shifted from an emphasis on understanding pathology in specific brain regions to characterizing disturbances of interconnected neural systems. This shift has paralleled rapid advances in connectomics, a field concerned with comprehensively mapping the neural elements and inter-connections that constitute the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a central role in these efforts, as it allows relatively cost-effective in vivo assessment of the macro-scale architecture of brain network connectivity. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to some of the basic concepts in the field and review how recent developments in imaging connectomics are yielding new insights into brain disease, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Specifically, we consider how research into circuit-level, connectome-wide and topological changes is stimulating the development of new aetiopathological theories and biomarkers with potential for clinical translation. The findings highlight the advantage of conceptualizing brain disease as a result of disturbances in an interconnected complex system, rather than discrete pathology in isolated sub-sets of brain regions.},

abstract = {Complex networks constitute a recurring issue in the analysis of neuroimaging data. Recently, network motifs have been identified as patterns of interconnections since they appear in a significantly higher number than in randomized networks, in a given ensemble of anatomical or functional connectivity graphs. The current approach for detecting and enumerating motifs in brain networks requires a predetermined motif repertoire and can operate only with motifs of small size (consisting of few nodes). There is a growing interest in methodologies for frequent graph-based pattern mining in large graph datasets that can facilitate adaptive design of motifs. The results presented in this paper are based on the graph-based Substructure pattern mining (gSpan) algorithm and introduce a manifold of ways to exploit it for data-driven motif extraction in connectomics research. Functional connectivity graphs from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during resting state and mental calculations are used to demonstrate our approach. Relying on either time-invariant or time-evolving graphs, characteristic motifs associated with various frequency bands were derived and compared. With a suitable manipulation, the gSpan discovers motifs which are specific to performing mental arithmetics. Finally, the subject-dependent temporal signatures of motifs' appearance revealed the transient nature of the evolving functional connectivity (math-related motifs "come and go").},

abstract = {The human brain can be studied as a hierarchy of complex networks on different temporal and spatial scales. On each scale, from gene, protein, synapse, neuron and microcircuit, to area, pathway and the whole brain, many advances have been made with the development of related techniques. Brain network studies on different temporal and spatial scales are booming. However, such studies have focused on single levels, and can only reflect limited aspects of how the brain is formed and how it works. Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to integrate a variety of techniques, methods and models, and to merge fragmented findings into a uniform research framework or platform. To this end, we have proposed the concept of the brainnetome and several related programs/projects have been launched in China. In this paper, we offer a brief review on the methodologies of the brainnetome, which include techniques on different scales, the brainnetome atlas, and methods of brain network analysis. We then take Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia as examples to show how the brainnetome can be studied in neurological and psychiatric disorders. We also review the studies of how risk genes for brain diseases affect the brain networks. Finally, we summarize the challenges for the brainnetome, and what actions and measures have been taken to address these challenges in China. It is envisioned that the brainnetome will open new avenues and some long-standing issues may be solved by combining the brainnetome with other "omes".},

Well ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets, the FCP and INDI have demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open science ethos.

abstract = {Brain connectivity can be represented by a network that enables the comparison of the different patterns of structural and functional connectivity among individuals. In the literature, two levels of statistical analysis have been considered in comparing brain connectivity across groups and subjects: 1) the global comparison where a single measure that summarizes the information of each brain is used in a statistical test; 2) the local analysis where a single test is performed either for each node/connection which implies a multiplicity correction, or for each group of nodes/connections where each subset is summarized by one single test in order to reduce the number of tests to avoid a penalizing multiplicity correction. We comment on the different levels of analysis and present some methods that have been proposed at each scale. We highlight as well the possible factors that could influence the statistical results and the questions that have to be addressed in such an analysis.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity analysis of fMRI data can reveal synchronised activity between anatomically distinct brain regions. Here, we extract the characteristic connectivity signatures of different brain states to perform classification, allowing us to decode the different states based on the functional connectivity patterns. Our approach is based on polythetic decision trees, which combine powerful discriminative ability with interpretability of results. We also propose to use ensemble of classifiers within specific frequency subbands, and show that they bring systematic improvement in classification accuracy. Exploiting multi-band classification of connectivity graphs is also proposed, and we explain theoretical reasons why the technique could bring further improvement in classification performance. The choice of decision trees as classifier is shown to provide a practical way to identify a subset of connections that distinguishes best between the conditions, permitting the extraction of very compact representations for differences between brain states, which we call discriminative graphs. Our experimental results based on strict train/test separation at all stages of processing show that the method is applicable to inter-subject brain decoding with relatively low error rates for the task considered.},

This drift has often been attributed to physiological noise or subject motion, but no studies have been done to test this assumption. Time series T*2-weighted volumes were acquired on two clinical 1.5 T MRI systems using spiral and EPI readout gradients from cadavers, a normal volunteer, and nonhomogeneous and homogeneous phantoms. The data were tested for significant differences (P = 0.001) from Gaussian noise in the frequency range 0.0-0.015 Hz. The percentage of voxels that were significant in data from the cadaver, normal volunteer, nonhomogeneous and homogeneous phantoms were 13.7-49.0\%, 22.1-61.9\%, 46.4-68.0\%, and 1.10\%, respectively. Low frequency drift was more pronounced in regions with high spatial intensity gradients. Significant drifting was present in data acquired from cadavers and nonhomogeneous phantoms and all pulse sequences tested, implying that scanner instabilities and not motion or physiological noise may be the major cause of the drift.},

abstract = {The scenario considered here is one where brain connectivity is represented as a network and an experimenter wishes to assess the evidence for an experimental effect at each of the typically thousands of connections comprising the network. To do this, a univariate model is independently fitted to each connection. It would be unwise to declare significance based on an uncorrected threshold of $\alpha$=0.05, since the expected number of false positives for a network comprising N=90 nodes and N(N-1)/2=4005 connections would be 200. Control of Type I errors over all connections is therefore necessary. The network-based statistic (NBS) and spatial pairwise clustering (SPC) are two distinct methods that have been used to control family-wise errors when assessing the evidence for an experimental effect with mass univariate testing. The basic principle of the NBS and SPC is the same as supra-threshold voxel clustering. Unlike voxel clustering, where the definition of a voxel cluster is unambiguous, 'clusters' formed among supra-threshold connections can be defined in different ways. The NBS defines clusters using the graph theoretical concept of connected components. SPC on the other hand uses a more stringent pairwise clustering concept. The purpose of this article is to compare the pros and cons of the NBS and SPC, provide some guidelines on their practical use and demonstrate their utility using a case study involving neuroimaging data.},

abstract = {In recent years, pathophysiological models of brain disorders have shifted from an emphasis on understanding pathology in specific brain regions to characterizing disturbances of interconnected neural systems. This shift has paralleled rapid advances in connectomics, a field concerned with comprehensively mapping the neural elements and inter-connections that constitute the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a central role in these efforts, as it allows relatively cost-effective in vivo assessment of the macro-scale architecture of brain network connectivity. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to some of the basic concepts in the field and review how recent developments in imaging connectomics are yielding new insights into brain disease, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Specifically, we consider how research into circuit-level, connectome-wide and topological changes is stimulating the development of new aetiopathological theories and biomarkers with potential for clinical translation. The findings highlight the advantage of conceptualizing brain disease as a result of disturbances in an interconnected complex system, rather than discrete pathology in isolated sub-sets of brain regions.},

Various methods exist for analyzing resting-state data, including seed-based approaches, independent component analysis, graph methods, clustering algorithms, neural networks, and pattern classifiers. Clinical applications of resting-state fMRI are at an early stage of development. However, its use in presurgical planning for patients with brain tumor and epilepsy demonstrates early promise, and the technique may have a future role in providing diagnostic and prognostic information for neurologic and psychiatric diseases.},
