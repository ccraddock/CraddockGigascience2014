	Estimating the functional interactions between brain regions and mapping those connections to inter-individual variability are central pursuits for understanding the human connectome. The number and complexity of funcitonal interactions withen the connectome and the large amounts of data required to study them position functional connectivity research as a ``big data'' problem. Maximimizing the degree to which knowledge about human brain function can be extracted from the connectome will require developing a new generation of neuroimaging analysis algorithms and tools. This review describes several outstanding problems in brain functional connectivity research with the goal of engaging researchers from a broad specturm of data sciences to help solve these problems. Additionally it provides information about open science resources consisting of raw and preprocessed data to help interested researchers get started.
